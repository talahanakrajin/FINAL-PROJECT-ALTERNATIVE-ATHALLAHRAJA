# FINAL-PROJECT-ALTERNATIVE-ATHALLAHRAJA
This is my alternative final project for ALGOPROG with Python. The project consists of a 2048 game implementation using Pygame.

## 2048 Game Implementation using Pygame

This project is a clone of the popular 2048 game implemented using the Pygame library. The game involves sliding numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

### Features:
- Smooth animations for tile movements.
- Random tile generation.
- Merging of tiles with the same value.
- Game over detection.
- "You Win" screen when a tile reaches 2048.
- Pause menu with options to resume, restart, or return to the main menu.
- Main menu with options to play or quit the game.

### How to Play:
1. Use the arrow keys to move the tiles.
2. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.
3. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
4. Press 'esc' to pause the game and access the pause menu.
5. Press 'R' to restart the game.
6. Press 'Play' on the main menu to start a new game.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have the Pygame library installed.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. The game window will open, and you can start playing by using the arrow keys.

Enjoy playing and experimenting with the 2048 game!
